=======

This script is currently undergoing a major rewrite. It will replace the terrible /race command with a proper gamemode implementation, with only one race running at once, spectator mode, comprehensive stats, menus, and more. I'm hoping to have it usable ~~very soon~~ eventually.

If you're interested in checking out the very unstable code, look in the '1.0' branch. It's progressing quite well so far, and could be described as usable, but there's a long way to go.

I am not accepting pull requests or new default courses. I would like to get this rewrite done, first.
