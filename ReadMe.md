For server owners
=======

This script is currently undergoing a rewrite. It will replace the terrible /race command with a proper gamemode implementation, with only one race running at once, spectator mode, and more. I'm hoping to have it usable very soon. If you're interested in checking out the (volatile) code, look in the ManagerRewrite3 branch.

I am not accepting pull requests or new default courses. I would like to get this rewrite done, first.
